🧠 What That Error Means
The dialog said:

Provide value on 'System.Windows.Baml2006.TypeConverterMarkupExtension' threw an exception. Line number '6' and line position '70'.

This points to a markup error in your App.xaml, likely caused by:

A malformed ImageBrush resource

A missing or unreadable image file

A converter trying to apply a value that fails at runtime
